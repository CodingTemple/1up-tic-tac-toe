# Tkinter Geometry Management and Functionality Explanation

## Geometry Management in Tkinter

Tkinter provides three geometry managers to arrange the widgets (such as buttons, labels, etc.) within a window:
1. **Pack:** Packs widgets into a container in the order they are added.
2. **Grid:** Arranges widgets in a grid format with rows and columns.
3. **Place:** Places widgets at specific coordinates within the window.

For the Tic Tac Toe app, the `grid` geometry manager is used to arrange buttons in a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe board.

## Functionality and Methods

### TicTacToe Class

#### `__init__(self, root)`

- Initializes the TicTacToe class with the root window.
- Sets the title of the window to "Tic Tac Toe".
- Initializes variables such as `player_turn` and `board`.
- Creates buttons for the Tic Tac Toe grid.

#### `setup_grid(self)`

- Places buttons on the grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe board using the `grid` geometry manager.

#### `on_button_click(self, idx)`

- Handles button clicks for marking X and lets the computer mark O.
- Checks if the clicked button is empty and there is no winner.
- Calls `make_move`, checks game status, and triggers the computer's move if necessary.

#### `make_move(self, idx, player)`

- Marks the board with the player's symbol.
- Sets the text of the clicked button to the player's symbol.
- Updates the board with the player's symbol.

#### `computer_move(self)`

- Implements simple AI for the computer's move.
- Checks for winning moves or blocks opponent's winning moves.
- Chooses a random empty spot if no immediate win or block is found.
- Updates the board and checks game status after the computer's move.

#### `check_winner(self)`

- Checks the board for a winner (either 'X' or 'O').
- Defines winning combinations and checks if any combination has the same symbol and is not empty.
- Returns the winning symbol if found, otherwise returns None.

#### `check_game_over(self)`

- Checks if the game is over (either a winner or a tie).
- Shows the appropriate message using a messagebox.
- Resets the game if necessary.

#### `reset_game(self)`

- Resets the game by clearing the board and setting the initial player turn.

### Main Function

#### `main()`

- Creates the main Tkinter window.
- Initializes the TicTacToe game.
- Starts the main event loop.

## Parameters and Methods Used

- **Tkinter Widgets:** `Button`, `Tk`, `messagebox`
- **Methods:** `grid`, `config`, `after`
- **Parameters:** `text`, `font`, `height`, `width`, `command`

These parameters and methods are used to create buttons, set their properties, manage their placement, handle button clicks, and display messages.
